                <h3>Sigiriya</h3>
                <p id="text1">Sigiriya, also known as Sinhagiri, is an ancient rock fortress in the northern Matale District of Sri Lanka's Central Province, near the town of Dambulla. It is a historical and archaeological site that is dominated by a massive column of granite rock that stands approximately 180 meters (590 feet) tall. According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Cavasa, this area was once a large forest, but due to storms and landslides, it was transformed into a hill and chosen by King Kashyapa (AD 477-495) as his new capital. He built his palace on top of the rock and painted the sides with vibrant frescoes. He constructed a gateway in the shape of a massive lion on a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock.</p>
